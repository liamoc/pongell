Pongell
-------

A crappy pong clone written in haskell, released into public 
domain by me, Liam O'Connor-Davis (kamatsu).

This game was written primarily as a proof of concept that
you can write games in haskell, and yes, it is nice, just 
like everything else is nice in haskell, because haskell
is awesome.

Seeing as there were some saying to the contrary in 
reddit, I thought I'd give it a go.

The code is completely uncommented, but fits in 127 lines,
which is neat compared to virtually every other language
(dynamic languages may get similar size, but haskell is
faster than them)

Controls are up for up and down for down. The ball will
speed up every 1000 frames so watch out.
